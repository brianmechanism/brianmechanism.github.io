						<!-- Text -->
						<section>
							<p>The Aragon Robotics Team was founded by a small group of students back in the 2000-2001 school year. Founding members sought to establish a lasting FIRST team that would continue to grow and inspire students for years to come.</p>
							<p>In the following years, Aragon Robotics won numerous awards, such as the Rookie All-Star, Entrepreneurship, and Engineering Inspiration Awards, culminating in successive trips to the FRC World Championships in 2012 and 2013. The team decided to temporarily discontinue FRC in 2015, creating 2 new FTC teams in its place alongside FTC Team 4345, which was piloted in 2010 and first made state championships in 2014.</p>
							<p>In 2018, with higher sponsor engagement, more funding, and a larger program, Aragon Robotics re-established FRC 840. Both 840 and 4345 experienced successful seasons, with 840 being picked as part of the 1st seed alliance at Silicon Valley Regionals and 4345 being awarded both the Think Award and the 2nd place Inspire Award. Aragon Robotics also features a growing business team that manages finances, media, and outreach for the whole organization.</p>
							<p>From the beginning, Aragon Robotics has been a student-built, student-run and student-led organization. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our members throughout the years, Aragon Robotics has grown from a six-person founding team to a thriving team of over 40 active members.</p>
