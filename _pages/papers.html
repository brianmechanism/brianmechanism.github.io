                    <h4>Novel Long Range Compound Linear Motion Mechanisms For use in the Design of Affordable

                    <p>
                        In all robotics applications, mechanical complexity is one of the major sources
                        considerably increasing the cost and leading to low adoption. This paper presents the
                        designs of 5 novel compound linear motion mechanisms with essentially unlimited range of
                        motion for use in both fixed and mobile robots. This makes it possible to affordably
                        scale fixed robots to commercial size farms as well as remove the complexity and related
                        costs in mobile agricultural robots introduced by precise sensors for navigation. Three
                        of the given mechanisms meet all the design aims required for successful adoption in
                        agricultural robots. The second mechanism is recommended for further study.
